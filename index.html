	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p>I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/centre/grenoble">Inria Grenoble Rhone-Alpes</a> in <a href="https://team.inria.fr/statify/">Statify</a> and <a href="http://thoth.inrialpes.fr">Thoth</a> teams (Grenoble, France), working under the supervision of <a href="http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/verbeek/">Jakob Verbeek</a> and <a href="https://www.julyanarbel.com">Julyan Arbel</a>. .</p>
	<p>I was born in Penza, a city that is not far from Moscow (650 km). In 2013 I moved to Moscow for my undergraduated studies.  In 2017 I obtained my Bachelor degree at <a href="https://mipt.ru/english/">Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT)</a> and started the second year of Master program at Grenoble Institute of Technology (<a href="http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr">Grenoble - INP, Ensimag</a>). During the second semester I had an internship at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes">Inria Grenoble Rhone-Alpes</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://www.julyanarbel.com">Julyan Arbel</a> and <a href="https://dasci.es/personal/perfil/pablo-mesejo-santiago/">Pablo Mesejo</a>. We investigated distributional properties of Bayesian neural networks, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05193">arXiv</a>. Now I continue this research during my graduate studies. My CV can be downloaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ix9xcKBxiIkW3pfqGq3lWdKfB7-P18Vt/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
