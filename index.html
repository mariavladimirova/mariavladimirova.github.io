	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p>I am a PhD student at Inria Grenoble Rhone-Alpes in Statify and Thoth teams (Grenoble, France).</p>
	<p>I was born in Penza, a city that is not far from Moscow (650 km). In 2013 I moved to Moscow for my undergraduated studies.  In 2017 I obtained my Bachelor degree at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) and started the second year of Master program at Grenoble Institute of Technology (Grenoble - INP, Ensimag). During the second semester I had an internship at Inria Grenoble Rhone-Alpes under the guidance of Julyan Arbel and Pablo Mesejo. We investigated distributional properties of Bayesian neural networks, see arXiv. Now I continue this research during my graduate studies under supervision of Jakob Verbeek and Julyan Arbel. My CV is here.</p>
